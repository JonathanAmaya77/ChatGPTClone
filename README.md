# ChatGPTClone
This was my final project for Mimo's AI certification ðŸš€

please take a look at this template of creating your own ChatGPT clone

OpenAI, the company under ChatGPT has an API that must be funded (minimum of $5).
When you have funds in your account you are able to access the API with your generated secret key. 

Once you have your secret key ðŸ”‘, you enter it into my code's 'api_key' within quotes. 

NOTE!!! You must copy and paste this code to your own device! Do not enter YOUR secret key and commit a change
That key MUST not be shared publicly and it is only for you, unless you have an organization. ðŸš¨
